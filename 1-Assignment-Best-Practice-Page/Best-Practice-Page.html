			<h3>Follow programming standards and conventions.</h3>
			<p>In software programming, there are different ways of doing the same thing. But for the sake of clarity and uniformity there are standards and conventions that most programmers abide by. An example of these are the naming of variables, functions, classes, etc. These standards and conventions may even vary for different languages and different companies. So the important thing to remember is to always follow these standards and conventions when working alone and follow the company's own standards and conventions when working for them.</p>
